			<hr>
			<p>
				<strong style="font-size:20px;">DoDream</strong> is a Korean traditional sound band at Duke University. Founded by a group of Duke students who wanted to share the authentic Korean culture through Korean traditional music, DoDream is an active performing group at Duke University.
			</p>
				DoDream is a "samulnori" group - Samulnori means "four different acts," basically describing the four instruments that come together to create one sound. The four instruments each symbolize components of rain, because samulnori is also called "poongmul," and it was a dance/sound done by farmers in hope for rain to ensure a good harvest in the fall. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The four instruments are the following:<br>
				<strong>Ggwanggwari (꽹과리/쇠):</strong> Represents the sound of thunder <br>
				<strong>Jannggoo (장구):</strong> Represent the sound of the rain<br>
				<strong>Book (북):</strong> Represents the sound of the clouds<br>
				<strong>Jing (징):</strong> Represents the sound of the wind
			</p>

				Past performances:<br>
				2011: Duke Springternational; FoodFest; Korea Night at Fuqua<br>
				2012: Duke LNY; Duke Springternational; Asia Night at UNC<br>
